                    <p>Yoga is a joyful and safe practice that can be used as a complimentary or integrative form of therapy for the aging population. As a specialized yoga practitioner for seniors and aging bodies those who practice yoga regularly have claimed yoga has helped improve their balance, relieve back pain, provide clarity in their mind, and much more!
                    There are many health benefits from practicing yoga for our aging bodies (and wiser souls)… including improving strength and mobility, increasing flexibility, minimizing pain, relieving anxiety and depression, and sustaining our highest quality of life at any age or stage of our life.

                <div class="col-6of12">
                    <p>After many years of only practicing yoga and Pilates due to injuries from sitting for long periods, sports, outdoor activities and intense exercise… I was on a quest to find a healthy balance between physical movement, environmental integrity and spiritual well-being. After moving across the country in search of love and personal growth, I discovered that Yoga is the healthy healing therapy I had consistently went to for my physical body, my despairing mind, and my connection to spirit.<br>
                    A sequence of events led me to meet an inspiring and motivating yoga teacher &#40;Jason, Yoga Tree Studios&#41; who provided me with the tools and knowledge to advance my practice and uncover my passion of life-long learning and teaching yoga.<br> 
                    Initially, my plan was merely to deepen my own yoga practice, since I had a successful corporate career. But the very first class I taught, which I was quite awful (really, really bad), I felt this sensation I had never felt that lifted me to another level. And despite it going terribly bad, I knew I needed to continue this path.<br>
                    I left my corporate job, returned to Vancouver to pursue my passion in creating a Yoga Health Centre, where older adults and people living with chronic ailments can use yoga as a form of ongoing treatment and therapy that allows them to live their best quality life at any age or phase in their lives!
                    This is how I founded Avatara Yoga and Integrative Health.
                    I, Kelly Yee am a certified Yoga Instructor &#40;YT250&#41;with specialized training from Duke Integrative Medicine in yoga for seniors and those living with ailments such as cancer, osteoporosis, and chronic pain. Additionally I hold a BCom. and MSc. 
                    My love for healthy living inspires me to research health sciences, integrative medicines, and aging-related illnesses where Yoga could be utilized to help with the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being of others.
